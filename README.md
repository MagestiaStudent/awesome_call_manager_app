# My honest thoughts on call notes managers app
a curated list of the best call management and application tools to improve phones by "la panache edito".

## Android applications - direct access
[Paid] memocallpro: the best call & contact manager app 
Rate: 4.5 / 5 – the app is paid at different levels (lite: 3.59 & pro: 2.79 EUR /mo) but it includes everything you could possibly want; everything works. the settings interface is a bit rough at first, but the call log interface is a breath of fresh air, you get used to it quickly. being able to access it on a computer without a cloud via wifi/modem is surely one of my favorite features, along with sms sending. another downside (which might be an asset for some) is that it doesn't follow a learning curve; in the pro trial version, you are given access to dozens of features without being told which profiles they are for. in reality, it's the best alternative to replace "call notes pro" by andrey nikanorov, which is no longer available. the app is updated and has complete documentation. it isn't strictly a crm, but it allows you to manage your contacts as if you had one—no limits on customer records, actions, or custom fields from the very first subscription. it's the best value for money. you can manage databases of 20,000 contacts and have computer access for the price of two loaves of bread and a coffee per month.

[Free for now] isung call notes app: the beautiful but not working always call notes app 
Rate: 2.5 / 5 – the app looks nice, but it doesn't really work; in fact, everything has to be edited manually. additionally, notes don't always display during calls. the calendar is actually quite nice, but it isn't connected to calls; after all, it’s not a call management app but a note management app. the notes are highly customizable, but i'm sorry, it just doesn't have the intended effect.

[Free for now] note call recorder: the old and not on google play app 
rate: eww/5  – the app only works correctly on older android versions and hasn't been updated since 2023. the interface is not optimal, and the call log features don't work on all devices. on an older phone, it’s not bad, but it only allows for recording calls. recording calls without consent is not legal in every country, and furthermore, having the...

[paid] your call: useful call & contact manager app and whatsapp 
rate: 3.5 / 5 – 
The app is paid and focused on WhatsApp automation, hence its $13 per month price tag.  The interface is not as clear as other similar apps, but there are some interesting UI elements.
The downside is that our data and contacts are stored in the cloud, which is quite annoying in terms of control (do they really need our phone number?). In addition, the free version is extremely limited, to the point of being unusable and useless: no one has only 25 contacts.
The overlay displays a lot of information on the screen during a call, which is surprising the first time, even though you can keep it as a floating icon, which is a good thing. However, it's not that useful if you have a clickable notification.


## Android applications - crm based
[paid] helloddial: call manager for sales rate: 4 / 5 – the app is a crm utility (i don't exclude it like other crms because while it requires installing another app, you don't really need to use the crm itself). the features are sales-oriented; the interface is aging, but it gets the job done. having tested salesforce, the value for money of hellodial is unbeatable compared to a crm and other apps of its level. at 6/month, it allows you to manage whatever you want as an indie hacker. if you start managing 50,000 contacts, it’s possible with hellodial.

[paid] runo: the beast sim-based call management crm paid 10$/mo (annually) to get a powerful sim-based crm app. if your business is growing fast and you want an ai assistant, this is the one.

## coming soon?
[unknown] call notes: the google pixel call notes manager?

## hall of shame? do you want to know my honest opinion on these companies selling you wearables for $170 or subscriptions for small businesses at $45/mo? I think we know it already.
