# My Honest Thoughts on Call Notes Managers Apps 📱
A curated list of the best call management and application tools to improve phone productivity, by "La Panache Edito".

## 📂 Android applications - direct access
🟢 [Paid] memocallpro: the best call & contact manager app 
Rate: 4.5 / 5 –  PRO : 3.2 $ / Month  and a Lite : 4 USD Life + LifeTime Deal + Free version
The settings interface is a bit rough at first, but the call log interface is a breath of fresh air—you get used to it quickly. One of my favorite features is the ability to access it on a computer/deskop or tablet, along with SMS sending and all the features with configuring call hours, ngl for personal use, it's perfect. 
For negative tought : It doesn't follow a typical learning curve. In the Pro trial, you get access to dozens of features without clear guidance on which profiles they are for - at least, you had a 30 day free trials to test it out. 

My note ; it's the best alternative to replace CALL NOTES PRO by Andrey Nikanorov, which is no longer available. The app is regularly updated and has complete documentation. While it isn't strictly a CRM, it allows you to manage contacts as if you had no limits on customer records, actions, or custom fields from the very first subscription. It is the best value for money: you can manage databases of 20,000 contacts for the price of two loaves of bread and a coffee per month. In his free version : you dont have customer record limites and have the overlay. 

🟠[Free for now] ISUNG CALL NOTES APP : Beautiful but Unreliable  
Rate: 2 / 5 – the app looks nice, but it doesn't really work; in fact, everything has to be edited manually. additionally, notes don't always display during calls. the calendar is actually quite nice, but it isn't connected to calls; after all, it’s not a call management app but a note management app. the notes are highly customizable, but i'm sorry, it just doesn't have the intended effect.

🔴 [Free for now] note call recorder: the old and not on google play app 
rate: eww/5  – the app only works correctly on older android versions and hasn't been updated since 2023. the interface is not optimal, and the call log features don't work on all devices. on an older phone, it’s not bad, but it only allows for recording calls. recording calls without consent is not legal in every country, and furthermore, having the...

🟡 [paid] Your Call : A Useful call & contact manager app and whatsapp 
rate: 3.5 / 5 – 13 $/ month
The interface is not as clear as other similar apps, but there are some interesting UI elements.
The downside is that our data and contacts are stored in the cloud, which is quite annoying in terms of control (do they really need our phone number?). In addition, the free version is extremely limited, to the point of being unusable and useless: no one has only 25 contacts. The overlay displays a lot of information on the screen during a call, which is surprising the first time, even though you can keep it as a floating icon, which is a good thing. However, it's not that useful if you have a clickable notification.
The app works with all features, so yes, if you install it, you will be able to track your calls, add notes and tags; it's a pena that the price is so high for basic features, despite what is stated on their website.


## 🏢 Android applications - crm based
🟢[paid] HELLODDIAL: Call Manager for Sales 
Rate: 4 / 5 :  7 $ / month.
The app is a crm utility (i don't exclude it like other crms because while it requires installing another app, you don't really need to use the crm itself). the features are sales-oriented; the interface is aging, but it gets the job done. having tested salesforce, the value for money of hellodial is unbeatable compared to a crm and other apps of its level. at 6/month, it allows you to manage whatever you want as an indie hacker. if you start managing 50,000 contacts, it’s possible with hellodial.

🟢 [paid] RUNO: The Beast of SIM-Based CRMs
Rate : 4.5 /Pay 10$/mo (annually)
Get a powerful sim-based crm app. if your business is growing fast and you want an ai assistant, this is the one. Nothing more to say, it is a really good CRM, data are on cloud like most of CRM.

## 🚀 Coming soon?
🟣 [unknown] call notes: the google pixel call notes manager?

## 💀 Do you want to know my honest opinion on these companies selling you wearables for $170 or subscriptions for small businesses at $45/mo? I think we know it already. Overpriced and unnecessary.
